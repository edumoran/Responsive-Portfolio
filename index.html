        <p>Hello! My name is Eduardo and I was born about 30 years ago in the beautiful city of Colima which is the unofficial branch office of hell (its really so damn hot all year round!).<br><br> I lived there for several years but eventually had to move out because of my studies. Before going on, here's a piece of advice for all of you young people out there: <strong>do not go to university right after highschool.</strong> Better to do some traveling, learning a language and working, these things really give you another perspective and they even help you realize what you are really good for. I wish someone had told me that back then, perhaps I would've chosen another career or at the very least I would've asked the right questions in class.<br><br>Anyway, I decided to go to design school because when I was growing up, I always wanted to know how things worked and how they were made. Engineering had a lot of weird and extremely difficult sciences and I wasn't up for that at all so I took another approach and graduated as an Industrial Designer, which pretty much gave me an insight on how things are made. Everything I was taught was very cool and all that but I didn't feel it was enough.<br><br> After a while trying to <strong><i>fall in line</i></strong> and after a couple of unsatisfying jobs, I decided I had had enough and I was ready to change some things. I packed my bags, sold what I could, and bought a one way ticket to Germany. Long story short, 6 years, 5 cities, 4 countries and hundreds of crazy and amazing stories later, I'm sitting in a cafe in Almaty, Kazakhstan writing this little bio.<br><br>If you managed to get this far, I congratulate you, and if you want to know some interesting facts about me then here they are: I'm a freelance data visualization specialist <i>and soon to be web designer</i> for Fairtrade, FSC, and FLOCERT (all based in Germany). However, <strong>my true passion turned out to be food</strong>, cooking to be more specific, I just love the whole experience, one can learn a lot of a person/culture just by listening to their stories around food.
